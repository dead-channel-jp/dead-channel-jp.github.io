<blockquote>
<p>Recalled Italo Calvino, Steven Millhauser, Seth Fried and variaous wirters, Muneo Ishikawa's works are unique at the way of showing impossible situations and resolving them in a Copernican revolution. Now I know the charm of reading his works. Looking forward for his next work.</p>

<p>Unfortunately genius. Surprising skills. Sentences are overwhelmming as a new comer, metaphors break your stereotypes. His theses seems like a fish story accidentally born in conversations, but it goes far as it grows like an egg breaks it's own shell. It's not neither a boring moral nor a sob story, but it displays a landscape outside of laughing, which you have never seen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A question about charaters is a question about love, and also a novel about characters is a philosophical thought experiment about love. Inheriting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motoko_Arai">Motoko Arai</a>'s <em>&quot;...Speechless&quot;</em>（…絶句）, Nagura updates it in this internet environment. This is a new born masterpiece of philosophical characters' novels. Narrative parts written in Kansai dialect are also good!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How &quot;Harlem End&quot; can be acceptable? <em>&quot;Alternative Sekaikei&quot;</em> renovates Sekaikei to Naroukei, mix the New Orthodox School Detective Novels, and extends the connections between every possible worlds. This is a strongest wide-screen metafication! The narrator is a very good man to make my tears drop.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Satoshi Ogawa is a Japanese fiction writer. Born in Chiba City at December 25th, 1986. Grown up in &quot;Danchi&quot; which is a modern condominium build at Japan's high economic growth era, he read all of Hayakawa Sci-Fi paperbacks in his father's bookshelf, who was a typical book warm. He entered <a href="https://www.shibumaku-en.jp/">Makuhari Senior and Junior High School</a> and then entered the University of Tokyo like tracing the ideal student's career in Chiba. At first, he studied science but changed his major subject to literature. He studied Kenji Nakagami who was a representative writer in Japanese 1990's. In his doctor courses of College of Art and Science, he studied about Alan Mathieson Turing. He likes online games like <em>&quot;Fortnite&quot;</em> but never use SNS.</p>
<p>Studying at the university in 2015, he won <strong>the 3rd Hayakawa Sci-Fi Contest</strong> with <em>&quot;This side of Eutronica&quot;</em> and made his debut as a writer. His 2nd book <em>&quot;Game Kingdom&quot;</em> won <strong>the 38th Japan Sci-Fi Award</strong> Grandprix and <strong>the 31st Yamamoto Shugoro Award</strong>. As a result of this quick success, he is receiving a lot of attentions. In spite of issuing 2 Sci-Fi books from his debut and recognizing himself as a Sci-Fi writer, people thinks his target will be over wrapping across multiple genres. His recent work <em>&quot;the Map and the Fist&quot;</em>（地図と拳） is apparently a history drama which draws <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria">Manchuria</a> before WWⅡ leaving  echo of Michel Houellebecq's <em>&quot;La carte et la territoire&quot;</em> in the title.</p>

<p>(About <em>&quot;Aureliano is coming&quot;</em>) Anyway, his skills are genuine to complete such a &quot;Grand Hotel Style&quot; story without any failure. Possibly, he might be  in his first step to much greater novels that I've never thought of.</p>

<p>(About <em>“Mind your P’s and Q’s”</em>) Takahashi writes any kind of stories very well. His characters are animated and he also has literary profundity. He seems to be able to write anything. I read without any stress and just feel awesome. None creates such story. It's really difficult to imagine and write that kind of story.</p>

<p>A novel is <strong>medium</strong> for readers with which the writer fix <strong>informations</strong> to <strong>stroies</strong>. “Stop Over”apparently has an intention to inform the writer's personal information. As a result, it describes well the sense that the world is blocked up.</p>
